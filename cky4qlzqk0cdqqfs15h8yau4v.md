## Writing Tools For Your Next Book

If you're an aspiring author, you may have used Google Docs or MS Word to write. They're by far the most popular word processors out there. But, it would be a painstaking process if you're writing a book using those tools.

It's easy to re-order or re-arrange some chapters if you're writing a book of 10,000 or 15,000 words. But, once you cross the limit, it becomes a terrible ordeal.

Some of the common pain points faced are:

- Re-arranging chapters
- Outlining
- Keeping track of the characters
- Statistics & Analytics
